## The Ten Weeks Bootcamp Model
This journey was inspired by the book: **Python Projects For Beginners,
by *Connor P. Milliken***

I'm doing this because of the fun of it! and I look forward to enjoying myself and also pick up some new things because one never steps in the same river twice, every book has a gift waiting to be unwrapped.
